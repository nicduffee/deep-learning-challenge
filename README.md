## Overview
The nonprofit foundation - Alphabet Soup, wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Their business team have provided a dataset containing 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Using this dataset we have designed a neural network which uses a binary classification model to predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful.
